                            request for a payout cannot be made while a game, involving the player that makes the
                            request, is being played.</p>


                        <p>The company fulfills payment obligations by transferring the requested amounts due to an
                            account named by the player and registered in the name of the player or by other payment
                            system, depending on technical availability on the website. Any transaction costs due are
                            borne by the player.</p>


                        <p>The company reserves the right to verify the entitlement of the player and, in case of doubt,
                            to retain the payment. To provide evidence of the entitlement, the player is required to
                            submit to the company a written request for payment and a copy of an official and valid
                            proof of identity (Passport, Voter ID, Aadhar, Pan Card, Driver's License) per mail, fax or
                            e-mail on request of the company. An identity check is carried out in the course of the
                            first pay out of winnings to the player, and in each case that the payout sum exceeds INR
                            1000. The personal data of the player owning the cash account and the owner of the bank
                            account must correspond. The company is entitled to request further evidence identifying the
                            player (e.g. A certified proof of identity) and verifying the named bank account prior to
                            any out-payment and to retain the amounts until sufficient evidence has been provided.</p>



                        <p>3.6 Player's right to use the funds in the Gaming Account</p>


                        <p>Funds in the Gaming Account may be used for gaming during the opening hours of the LUDO HIND,
                            provided that the Gaming account has not been frozen, blacklisted or closed
                            The Player is not entitled to funds that have been obtained through cheating or other
                            breaches of the gaming rules or the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, criminal
                            activities, the manipulation of the gaming system, or by any other inappropriate means. The
                            Operator reserves the right to limit the Player's access to the LUDO HIND and/or the right
                            to withhold any funds in the Gaming Account for a time period decided by the Operator if the
                            Operator suspect or can prove that the Player has broken the gaming rules and/or the Terms
                            and Conditions of this Agreement, or for other reasons of security.
                        </p>


                        <p>The Operator reserves the right to check and verify a Player's identity and title to a means
                            of payment and entitlement to the funds before a transfer at any time.</p>



                        <p>As a result of such a check, the Operator has the right to withhold the funds in the Gaming
                            Account and is not responsible or liable for any payment delays or other delays due to these
                            checks. In case of suspicious behavior, the check and verification may take up to six (6)
                            months to complete. This time period may be affected by legislation or decisions by
                            authorities. During the time it takes to complete the process, the requested funds shall be
                            stored as frozen funds in the Player's Gaming Account.</p>



                        <p>3.7 No pledging or currency speculation</p>


                        <p>Funds in the Gaming Account may not be pledged. The Gaming Account may not be used for
                            currency speculation. The Operator reserves the right, when necessary, to repay the funds
                            deposited into the Gaming Account by the Player in accordance with the exchange rate in
                            force at the time of the deposit.</p>



                        <p>3.8 Possibility for the Player to freeze the Gaming Account</p>


                        <p>The Player may freeze the gaming function himself/herself for a time period he/she deems
                            appropriate. Should the action be executed more than three times per calendar year, the
                            Operator may consider terminating the customer's account.</p>


                        <p>3.9 Possibility for the Player to blacklist himself/herself</p>


                        <p>The Player may inform the Operator that he/she is to be blacklisted. Blacklisting means here
                            that the Player wants to prohibit himself/herself from using his/her Gaming Account, and
                            that he/she is to be prohibited from opening a new Gaming Account. The Operator shall carry
                            out the blacklisting at the request of the Player. Notice of this shall be given in writing
                            to the Operator's customer service.</p>


                        <p>The Operator shall not pay any interest on funds deposited in the Operator's bank account by
                            the Player. The Operator shall not pay any interest on funds entered into the Gaming
                            Account.</p>

                        <p>3.10 Control over entries</p>


                        <p>The Operator shall not issue any gaming certificates or receipts regarding individual entries
                            in the Gaming Account. The entries shall be accounted electronically in the LUDO HIND. The
                            Player agrees to check that the entries in the Gaming Account are congruent with the actions
                            taken by the Player.
                        </p>

                        <p>3.11 Complaints and expiration</p>

                        <p>Complaints regarding for instance erroneous payment or un-received winnings shall be made in
                            writing and delivered to the Operator within 30 days calculated from the moment the
                            deviation was or should have been detected. Should the Operator not have received the
                            complaint within the said time limit, the Player shall lose his/her right to invoke the
                            deviation. The Operator saves transaction data for up to 90 days, after which the Operator
                            shall have the right to delete such data.
                            The Player shall immediately inform the Operator after having detected a failure in the
                            closing, freezing, blacklisting, etc. of the Gaming Account, performed by the Operator or
                            the Player. In no event shall the Operator be liable for any fees the Player has been able
                            to place subsequent to the closing, freezing or blacklisting of the account or limitation
                            set by the Player. The decision to become a customer and therefore the responsibility for
                            using the LUDO HIND is taken solely by the Player.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>4. Limitations Regarding Gaming</strong></p>

                        <p>4.1 Generals</p>

                        <p>The Player undertakes to always follow the applicable gaming rules for all games that are
                            provided by the LUDO HIND in addition to the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement. Any
                            breach of the gaming rules or the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement will automatically
                            mean that the Gaming Event is declared void and the Player will forfeit their entitlement to
                            any winnings from any such void games. The Operator reserves the right to declare the games
                            bid at any time during the customer relationship as a result of the Player's breach of the
                            Terms and Conditions of this Agreement or of the rules.</p>

                        <p>If the Player discovers a bug or any other error in the system, he/she must immediately log
                            out from the LUDO HIND. The Player may never profit from a bug or error in the Gaming
                            system. The Player shall immediately inform the Operator after having detected a bug or any
                            other error on or in connection to the LUDO HIND.</p>


                        <p>4.2 Invalid games and forbidden behavior</p>

                        <p>The Operator reserves the right to declare the Gaming Event of the Player void, entirely or
                            partly, should it become evident that, for example: It has been offered, requested or
                            accepted on the grounds of an error; the Player or third parties acting in cooperation with
                            the Player jointly intend to evade the Agreement; the Player is disqualified from
                            participating in Gaming Events in which the Player or other party acting in cooperation with
                            the Player may directly or indirectly influence the end result; and/or the outcome of the
                            Gaming Event has, directly or indirectly, been influenced through criminal activities.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Player must personally perform all actions in regards to the Gaming Account and all
                            payments to the account shall be made solely for the benefit of the Player.</p>
                        <p>
                            Third parties may not be given access to the LUDO HIND through the Player's Gaming Account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The following behavior, amongst other things, is strictly forbidden in relation to the LUDO
                            HIND: use or attempted use, of external gaming assistance programs (EPA programs) including
                            but not limited to, program or non-program based databases and profiles, for instance
                            websites and subscription services created with the purpose of giving the Player an unfair
                            advantage.
                        </p>


                        <p>By unfair advantage we mean a situation in which a Player has access to or complies
                            information on other Players that the Player has not observed during his/her own use of the
                            LUDO HIND; use or attempted use, of artificial intelligence or software that will play on
                            behalf of the Player or direct the Player on how to play, e.g. so-called "robots"; collusion
                            or attempted collusion by exchanging information on hidden cards or other means,
                            irrespective of the outcome of such an attempt. The Operator reserves the right, in addition
                            to other measures, to prevent using the LUDO HIND and/or ban the player from playing at a
                            particular table or tournament, including the right not to allow two or more players to play
                            at the same table or in the same tournament together; any attempt to change, modify, break
                            down, reverse engineer or in any other way attempt to ascertain how the program is built;
                            and/or any other fraudulent conduct or attempted fraudulent conduct, according to the
                            Operator, irrespective of the outcome of such an attempt, including but not limited to
                            examples of illegal, dishonest or inappropriate behaviour during use of the LUDO HIND.</p>

                        <p>Measures include the above measures for other types of gaming manipulation or illegal
                            payment, including but not limited to the use of stolen account or credit cards, illegal
                            credit, repayment or money laundering.</p>

                        <p>The Player agrees that the Operator may take measures themselves or via a third party
                            supplier to discover and/or prevent collusion, use of prohibited EPA programs, robots,
                            chip-dumping and any other fraudulent or improper behavior. The Player or any person who
                            intends to register with the LUDO HIND is responsible at all times for ensuring the legality
                            of using or registering for the LUDO HIND in the country or region where the Player is
                            located.</p>

                        <p>4.3 Promo Cash</p>

                        <p>Promo cash will have an expiry date which will be at the discretion of LUDO HIND management

                        <p>4.4 No Refund</p>

                        <p>If game ends because player refreshes browser or clicks on back button or due to network
                            failure or any other computer related issue the game will be considered as completed and no
                            refund will be given.</p>

                        <p>4.5 Limited areas</p>

                        <p>The Player has the responsibility to ensure that the Player complies with all laws in any
                            jurisdiction that apply to the Operator. If the Player lives in a state with India or other
                            countries where the LUDO HIND is prohibited the Player must neither register nor attempt to
                            use the LUDO HIND.</p>

                        <p>4.6 Illegal behavior</p>

                        <p>The Operator has a zero tolerance policy for illegal behavior and can, should this occur, or
                            there is a reasonable suspicion of it occurring, terminate the Customer Relationship and the
                            Gaming Account immediately and will cooperate with the authorities if there are grounds to
                            do so.</p>

                        <p><strong>5. Opening Hours</strong></p>

                        <p>The LUDO HIND is open to gaming activities during the hours determined by the Operator. The
                            opening hours shall be announced in the LUDO HIND. The aforesaid also applies to the
                            Operator's customer service and other office functions.</p>

                        <p><strong>6. Rake</strong></p>

                        <p>The Operator provides a platform for Player's to play games with each other using the
                            Software. In consideration of the provision by us of the facility for you to challenge and
                            play with other users, we charge an administrative fee (known as a rake). We may wish to
                            modify the terms of this Agreement (including our privacy policy and game rules) to review,
                            for example, any of our game rules, any minimum and maximum stakes offered or the rate of
                            rake that we charge.</p>

                        <p><strong>7. Winnings and Payment of Winnings</strong></p>

                        <p>The winnings as well as potential repayment of gaming expenses are automatically entered in
                            the Gaming Account of the Player. A Player can request a transfer from the Gaming Account to
                            a specified bank account or to an e-wallet provided that the Operator is able to use the
                            payment method. The winnings shall be paid to the Gaming Account as soon as possible after
                            the game has ended or the results have been confirmed.</p>

                            result of a delay or inability to complete payment of the winnings.</p>

                        <p>Winnings cannot be exchanged or cashed in for another prize. The Player is solely responsible
                            for any taxes and fees which may arise in connection with a win. The Operator is in no way
                            responsible for any consequences of the Player's transfer of winnings or any other action
                            taken in connection with the win.
                            Players requiring information on tax or legal issues are recommended to contact an advisor
                            or the authorities in the country where the Player resides.

                        <p><strong>8. No Representations of Warranties</strong></p>

                        <p>The Player, not limiting his/her statutory rights, expressly acknowledges and agrees to the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>
                            The Player uses the LUDO HIND at his or her own risk. The LUDO HIND is provided "as is." The
                            Operator expressly disclaims all express or implied representations or warranties.</p>

                            Certain delays can occur in the Operator's system/network. The Operator reserves the right
                            to set the result of each Gaming Event in the LUDO HIND. By registering as a Player and
                            using the LUDO HIND, the Player is bound by such decisions.</p>

                        <p>
                            The Player shall be solely responsible for damages to his or her data system or for loss of
                            data arising from downloads of content from the LUDO HIND.</p>
                        <p>
                            No guidance or information, written or oral, obtained from the Operator or via the LUDO
                            HIND, shall constitute any warranty, which has not specifically been stated in these terms
                            and conditions.
                        </p>


                        <p><strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

                        <p>The Player specifically acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall the Operator be liable
                            for any direct or indirect damage, including but not limited to, delay, damages caused by
                            unused opportunity of the LUDO HIND, loss of profits, goodwill, licenses of data or other
                            financial loss arising out of: the use of the LUDO HIND or inability to use the LUDO HIND;
                            costs arisen from acquiring a replacement of any product or service that is based on any
                            item, data, information or service purchased through the LUDO HIND, from any message
                            received through the LUDO HIND or any transactions made by means of the LUDO HIND; third
                            party claims against the Player; unlawful access to or modifications of data transmissions;
                            or any other circumstances related to the LUDO HIND.
                            The Operator exempts itself from any claims for damages relating to the LUDO HIND's access,
                            function, quality, possible errors such as spelling errors, bugs and other factors relating
                            to the LUDO HIND.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>10. Force Majeure</strong></p>

                        <p>The Operator shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of force majeure or
                            other similar circumstances, directly or indirectly affecting the Operator and unreasonably
                            complicating the Operator's activities (force majeure). Examples of force majeure events are
                            real or potential labour disputes, governmental actions, war or threat of war, sabotage,
                            civil unrest, demonstrations, fire, storm, flooding, explosion, earthquake, provisions or

                            the LUDO HIND entitles the Operator to suspend or limit the LUDO HIND until further notice.
                        </p>


                        <p><strong>11. Amendments to the LUDO HIND, Gaming Rules or Agreement Terms</strong></p>

                        <p>The Operator reserves the right to make amendments to the LUDO HIND as well as, when
                            necessary, to amend the gaming rules without prior notice to the Player. Information on any
                            amendment shall be given in the LUDO HIND. The Operator reserves the right to amend the
                            terms of this Agreement at any time. Should the Operator introduce an Agreement term that
                            increases the responsibilities of the Player or decreases his/her rights and is not based on
                            laws, regulations or rulings of authorities, the Player shall be informed thereof by a
                            notice published on the LUDO HIND or by a notice sent to the Player's mail box in the LUDO
                            HIND or to the e-mail address the Player has last registered with the Operator.
                            Should the Player not approve the new term of the Agreement, the Player shall serve a
                            written notice of termination of Agreement prior to the application of the new Agreement
                            term has begun. Otherwise the new term is binding to the Player.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>12. Player's Right to Close the Gaming Account</strong></p>

                        <p>The Player may terminate the Gaming Account with the Operator by serving a written notice of
                            termination of the Agreement. Before terminating the account, the Operator shall wait until
                            the end results of any open Gaming Events have been received. Upon termination the Operator
                            shall close the Gaming Account of the Player, from where the funds in the Gaming Account
                            that the Player is entitled to shall, at the request of the Player, be transferred to the
                            bank account or e-wallet the Player supplies to the Operator. If the Player does not contact
                            the Operator within three (3) years of the expiration of the Gaming Account, the Player's
                            entitlement to the funds remaining in the Gaming Account will lapse.</p>

                        <p><strong>13. The Operator's Right to Freeze, Blacklist or Terminate the Gaming
                                Account</strong></p>

                        <p>The Operator retains the right to freeze, blacklist and/or terminate the Gaming Account
                            immediately and without any prior notice or giving any reason to the Player in the following
                            situations:</p>

                        <p>The Player has breached the Agreement or gaming rules;
                            The Player has, according to the Operator, unsuitable or forbidden equipment in relation to
                            use of the LUDO HIND;
                            The Operator has reason to impugn the Player's right to use the Gaming Account;
                        </p>

                        <p>The Operator has reason to suspect a crime, misuse, fraud, or attempt of such in relation to
                            use of the LUDO HIND;
                            No transactions have been registered for the Gaming Account for a period of 24 months;
                            The Operator is forced to do so pursuant to legislation or ruling of authority; and/or
                        </p>

                        <p>The Operator considers it to be necessary, for example, for safety reasons or due to the
                            Operator's reputation, etc. Freezing can occur in relation to the entire LUDO HIND, or be
                            limited to certain games or services provided.
                            The Operator retains the right to retain funds in the Gaming Account and/or reclaim funds
                            that have been acquired through cheating or other breaches of the gaming rules or the Terms
                            and Conditions of this Agreement, criminal conduct, manipulation of the LUDO HIND or any
                            other inappropriate manner including attempts at such conduct or suspicion thereof.
                            Players whose Gaming Accounts have been frozen, or whose Customer Relationship has been
                            ended on the basis of the reasons given above, or if the Operator otherwise finds it
                            necessary, will not be entitled to participate in the Operator's physical gaming
                            tournaments, or any of the Operator's other events.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>14. Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>

                        <p>The content of the Operator's LUDO HIND is protected by Indian and international copyright
                            acts and treaties. All reproduction or distribution of any material on the Operator's LUDO
                            HIND, including but not limited to text, photographs, movies, music and software programs is
                            strictly prohibited, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The Operator reserves any and all
                            rights not expressly granted herein.</p>

                        <p>The Operator's trade name and logotype and all related trademarks, product and/or service
                            names and slogans used in the LUDO HIND are the property of the Operator and may not be used
                            in any way without the prior written approval of the Operator. The Player's use of the LUDO
                            HIND shall not be construed as granting any license or right to use any trademarks or names
                            appearing on the Operator's website or in connection with the LUDO HIND without the prior
                            written consent of the Operator or proper third party.</p>

                        <p><strong>15. Term of the Agreement</strong></p>
                        <p>This Agreement is valid until further notice.</p>
                        <p><strong>16. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

                        <p>The terms of service shall be governed by the laws of India.
                            You agree that the Gaming Operator is deemed to be solely based in India, and nothing shall
                            give rise to personal jurisdiction over us in jurisdictions other than Chennai, India and
                            you shall not raise any claims against us in any court/s or forum in any jurisdiction other
                            than India.
                            Any claim or dispute between the player and Gaming Operator will be entertained and tried
                            solely and exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Bihar, West bengal,
                            India and no other place whatsoever.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>17. Legal Aspects</strong></p>

                        <p>LUDO HIND only offers cash tournaments in games of skills.
                            Participating in games of skill competitions for cash prizes is LEGAL in all states of India
                            except Assam, Odisha and Telangana.
                        </p>

                        <p>Under Indian Laws gambling is different from Skill Games. Gambling or gaming has been defined
                            by the Supreme Court in 1996 as betting and wagering on games of chance only.
                            The Supreme Court in this judgment specifically excludes games of skill, irrespective of
                            whether they</p>
                        <p>
                            play for money or not, from the definition of gambling. The exact quote from the 1996
                            judgment is as follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            "The expression ‘gaming’ in the two Acts has to be interpreted in the light of the law
                            laid-down by this Court in the two 1957 cases, wherein it has been authoritatively held that
                            a competition which substantially depends on skill is not gambling. Gaming is the act or
                            practice of gambling on a game of chance. It is staking on chance where chance is the
                            controlling factor. ‘Gaming’ in the two Acts would, therefore, mean wagering or betting on
                            games of chance. It would not include games of skill like horse racing”.</p>
                        <p>
                            Further the Public Gambling Act, which is the central law on gambling and most subsequent
                            state laws on the subject substantially state that “nothing in this Act shall apply to games
                            of mere skill wherever played”.
                            Supreme Court of India in 1996 defined a game of mere skill as follows: (1) The competitions
                            where success depends on substantial degree of skill are not "gambling". (2) Despite there
                            being an element of chance if a game is preponderantly a game of skill it would nevertheless
                            be a game of "mere skill".
