                            under the information Technology Act, 2000 and the rules made thereunder and the amended
                            provisions pertaining to electronic documents / records in various statutes as amended by
                            the information Technology Act, 2000. This Privacy Policy does not require any physical,
                            electronic or digital signature and is a legally binding document between You and Ludo Hind.
                        </p>


                        <p>1.3 We take the privacy of Our Users seriously. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy

                        <p></strong>4. CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>

                        <p>4.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, We will keep Your Personal
                            Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless We believe in good

                            You is necessary for Permitted Use or to:</p>

                        <p>4.1.1 Comply with a court order or other legal process;</p>

                            third-parties.</p>

                        <p><strong>5. SECURITY</strong></p>

                        <p>5.1 The security of Your Personal Information is important to Us. We follow generally
                            accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Us, both during
                            transmission and once We receive it. All information gathered on Our Website is securely
                            stored within Our controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a
                            firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.</p>

                        <p>5.2 Although We make best possible efforts to store Personal Information in a secure
                            operating environment that is not open to the public, You should understand that there is no
                            such thing as complete security, and We do not guarantee that there will be no unintended
                            disclosures of Your Personal Information. If We become aware that Your Personal Information
                            has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, We will use
                            reasonable efforts to notify You of the nature and extent of such disclosure (to the extent
                            We know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.</p>

                        <p><strong>6. COOKIES</strong></p>

                        <p>6.1 To improve the responsiveness of the sites for Our Users, We may use “cookies”, or
                            similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random
                            number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User’s individual interests
                            using the Identified Computer. Unless You voluntarily identify yourself (through
                            registration, for example), We will have no way of knowing who You are, even if We assign a
                            cookie to Your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information
                            You supply. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
                            their own cookies to Your browser (if You click on their ads), a process that We do not
                            control.</p>

                        <p>6.2 Our web servers automatically collect limited information about Your computer’s
                            connection to the Internet, including Your IP address, when You visit Our site. (Your IP
                            address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send You data
                            — such as the web pages You view.) Your IP address does not identify You personally. We use
                            this information to deliver Our web pages to You upon request, to tailor Our site to the
                            interests of Our Users, to measure traffic within Our site and let advertisers know the
                            geographic locations from where Our visitors come.</p>


                        <p><strong>7. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

                        <p>7.1 We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy
                            Policy so please review it frequently. If We do, then We will post these changes on this
                            page. In all cases, use of information We collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect
                            at the time such information is collected.</p>

                        <p><strong>8. YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>

                        <p>8.1 You have a right to correct any errors in Your Personal Information available with Us.
                            You may request Us in writing that We cease to use Your Personal Information.</p>
